# Ecotronics

This is a project made during SoSpectra's 2020 hackathon contest. We wanted to address several things including tech illiteracy, tech access, and e-waste dumps in places 
like African and Asian countries. These are very series issues, and it takes an army to help. We could've just made a linktree or a carrd or something,
but to code a full-fledged website is even better.
