# Ecotronics

This is a project made during SoSpectra's 2020 hackathon contest. 

## The Issue:

We wanted to address several things including tech illiteracy, tech access, and e-waste dumps in places like African and Asian countries. These are very serious 
issues, and it takes an army to help. We could've just made a linktree or a carrd or something, but to code a full-fledged website is even better.

## Our Solution:

We decided to create a full-fledged website that teaches people about the issue of e-waste, as well as provides them with places for them to donate their unwanted 
electronics. We also offer projects that users can do to repurpose their e-waste, as well as provide basic IT basics to help users better understand their 
electronic devices.
