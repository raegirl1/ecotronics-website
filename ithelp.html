    <p>Technology is an integral part of our lives, with many careers valuing extensive technology skill sets and
        backgrounds,
        but many people are not very literate when it comes to tech. Do you know what phishing is? Did you ever wonder
        what a GUI was?
        Do you know the difference between an OS and application programs? Have you even heard of a GUI? Listed below
        is a crash course on computers and important terminology that you may encounter. </p>
    <HARDWARE id="hardware"></HARDWARE>
    <h3>HARDWARE: WHAT IS IT?</h3>
    <p>Hardware is the physical components of your computer. This includes your input and output devices.
        Some examples of input devices are listed below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mouse</b></li>
        <li><b>Keyboard</b></li>
        <li><b>Microphone</b></li>
        <li><b>Touchpad:</b> For laptops, it allows the user to move the cursor around.</li>
        <li><b>Touchscreens: </b> Touch-sensitive screens, in which you can used your finger or a stylus. Your smart
            phones and tablets are good examples of this.
        </li>
        <li><b>Webcam:</b> For video transmission over the Internet.</li>
        <li><b>Scanner: </b>Scans documents and text and digitalizes them.</li>
    </ul>
    Some examples of output devices are listed below:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Screen/monitor</b></li>
        <li><b>Speakers</b></li>
        <li><b>Printers: </b> Can either be a laser (better for black and white/text) printer,
            or an inkjet (better for colored documents/photos) printer.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Types of Computers:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mainframes: </b>Large computers that store large amounts of data. These are often used by large
            companies, such as banks.
        </li>
        <li><b>Personal Computers: </b> Computers that are meant for individual use, and include desktops, laptops, and
            tablet PCs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Bigger Picture:</h4>
    Have you ever wondered what goes on... inside of your computer? Below are some internal components of computers:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Processors: (CPU) </b> Known as the central processing unit, it processes instructions.</li>
        <li><b>Ports: </b> This includes the USB (universal serial bus) which allows external devices
            to connect to the computer.
        </li>
        <li><b>HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface): </b>Allows you to connect monitors and projectors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How Is Data Stored?</h4>
    <p>Computers store data as bits (1's or 0's) and is the smallest unit of information. Similarly, these bits make up
        larger units of data: 8 bits make up one byte, and 1000 bytes make up a kilobyte. From there, we increase to
        megabytes, gigabytes, and even terabytes of data.</p>
    We can store data using some of these storage devices:
    <ul>
        <li><b>CD-ROM: </b> Our old friend, the compact disc. Burnt with a laser light, you can store music and some
            data on here.
        </li>
        <li><b>USB flash drives and memory cards: </b>Are generally faster, have more capacity and are much more
            portable.
        </li>
        <li><b>Hard disks: </b>Contains one or more magnetic disks; hard drives
            can be installed into your PC/external devices.
        </li>
        <li><b>Online storage</b></li>
        <li><b>Someday, holographic storage!: </b> Uses laser beams to store the data in three dimensions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>RAM vs. ROM</h4>
    <p>Random access memory (RAM) is similar to that of short-term memory: when the electricity is gone, memory is lost.
        A part of the operating system is loaded here. More RAM means that the computer does not have to refer to the
        slower reading hard disk. Read only memory (ROM) is not deleted when there is not electricity, and can not be
        written over. The Basic Input Output
        System (BIOS) can also be found here, which helps the PC to become functional after being turned on, and starts
        up the oeprating system.</p>

    <SOFTWARE id="software"></SOFTWARE>
    <h3>SOFTWARE: WHAT IS IT?</h3>
    <p>Any type of computer program is software. This includes the operating system (OS) and application software. </p>
    <h4>What's Your Favorite OS?</h4>
    <p>An operating system is a set of instructions, data, or programs which can be used to
        operate your computer and allows you to perform specific tasks. It controls program execution and controls
        access to the hardware. Some common operating systems are Windows, Linux, Android, and MacOS.</p>
    <h4>"Oh, Like That Microsoft Office Thing!"</h4>
    <p>Some common programs that you'll come across are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Word processing:</b> i.e. Microsoft Word
        <li><b>Databases: </b>Contain and work with large amounts of data.</li>
        <li><b>Presentation: </b> i.e. Microsoft PowerPoint, slideshows</li>
        <li><b>E-mail programs:</b> i.e. Gmail, Windows Mail</li>
        <li><b>Web browsers: </b> i.e. Google Chrome, Bing, Firefox, etc., what's your favorite browser?</li>
        <li><b>Image editing programs: </b> i.e. Adobe Photoshop, GIMP</li>
        <li><b>Computer games</b></li>
    </ul>
    These programs can also support people with disabilities, such as offering speech recognition and and screen
    readers.
    <h4>Gooey? No, GUI!</h4>
    <p>A graphical user interface, or GUI, allows you to use software applications through the use of graphical elements
        such as buttons, icons, and other visual elements.</p>

    <CYBERSECURITY id="cybersecurity"></CYBERSECURITY>
    <h3>CYBERSECURITY</h3>

    The internet is an intergral part of our daily lives, and it’s important that as netizens we
    do everything that we can to protect our data. Below are some basic tips and tricks on
    how to protect yourself online; and what to do in the event that you encounter an attack.<br/>

    <h4>Malware: Don’t Click The Link!</h4>
    <p>Malicious software that one can obtain by clicking on suspicious links and
        installing harmful software. The software may have the capability to install other
        harmful software, or ultimately make your system inoperable!</p>

    <h4> Phishing: Too Good To Be True?</h4>
    <p>Ever look into your emails only to find that you’ve suddenly won a million
        dollars? Phishing involves a person or organization pretending to be a trusted source
        only to trick people into giving them sensitive information, and is the leading cause
        of cyber attacks across the globe.</p>

    <h4>Man-in-the-Middle: Who Are You, Really?</h4>
    <p>The attacker will intercept your messages, and tamper with them. It is also known as an eavesdropping attack!
        This can be combated by encrypting the data, and that companies also audit and monitor their employees'
        activities.</p>

    <h4>DDoS: Very Obnoxious!</h4>
    <p>This attack is conducted by bombarding a company's central server with simultaneous data requests. The time
        frame of the attack can range, from a few minutes, to as long as a month. By executing this type of cyber
        attack,
        hackers can force their victims to send them money or information.</p>

    <h4>Tips and Tricks To Keep Yourself Safe!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Make your password something difficult:</b> We always hear stories about people who make their
            passwords '123456' or 'password'. DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE! Complicated passwords make it harder for
            hackers to access your data. Include special characters such as '@' for a's or '$' for s's.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>If it looks fishy, don't click it!: Clicking on unknown or suspicious links may result in downloading
            malicious files or software. Try to make sure that the website address starts
            with "https" rather than "http." Avoid clicking on advertisements that offer you a free download to a game
            or a
            free device! (Besides, it's illegal!) Instead, support the creators, and purchase the content legally!</b>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>Do not respond to suspicious emails:</b> We all get emails that congratulate us for winning a million
            dollars, please submit your credit card information to receive it, or that they need a response
            regarding the warranty on your car that you never had to begin with. Do not reply to an email unless
            you know who exactly it is you are communicating with. Delete these types of emails right away.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>Don't Forget to Log Out!: </b>When using public computers, never forget to log out. Closing the browser
            <b>does not</b> mean that you were logged out of your account. Refrain from your browser remembering your
            log in credentials as well.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <NETWORKS id="network-terms"></NETWORKS>
