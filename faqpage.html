        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: What's up with Tiktok? Facebook? Am I being tracked?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: It’s really important to keep your data safe. We will teach you methods to maximize your opportunity
            to stay safe on the net.
           While you can’t stay 100% private on social media,
           taking initiative is the first step.
           2012/2014 - Instagram & WhatsApp acquired by Facebook
           2018 - Mark Zuckerberg, FB CEO, went on trial for privacy
           issues and was involved in sketchy research
           studies with Cambridge Analytica.
           2020 - Tik Tok comes under fire for being owned by
           a Chinese Corporation, bytedance. Businesses are required,
           by law, to report ALL data to the CCP.
           So, yes, you most certainly being tracked (US, China, Russia, or otherwise.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="py-4">
        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: Net Neutrality - What is it?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: It is a concept that ideas should be free and open on the net
            for collaboration. Knowledge is power, and we can’t do any of
            this alone. Initiatives such as SOPA and PIPA have come under fire
            for protecting corporations and big government in the United States.
            Examples of gatekeeping against net neutrality include GALE and JSTOR,
            two research journal libraries only available on University campuses.</p>
    </div>
            <div class="py-4">
        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: What's Information Technology?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: It is the study of how information is spread, retrieved, and stored; especially through technology.</p>
    </div>
            <div class="py-4">
        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: What is the difference between CyberSecurity and IT?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: Both deal with similar concepts, only, CyberSecurity deals more with
                encryption and algorithms; IT is less specialized than CyberSec.</p>
    </div>

            <div class="py-4">
        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: xxx website got hacked! Should I change passwords?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: First, yes; change your passwords. Secondly, it is recommended to change
                them  every six months but no one really does that. Lastly, check if you were exposed, here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/</p>
    </div>

    <div class="py-4">
        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: Why should I care about this and basic IT Knowledge?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: We are coming to a point where pen-and-paper is going to
            be yesterday’s data manager and main source of info.
            As a result, we are coming to a point where Tech illiteracy
            and tech scarcity are going to be very big issues.
            So, take advantage of these sweet resources as
            much as you can!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="py-4">
        <h4 class="typography-h4">Q: Is the internet forever?</h4>
        <p class="typography-body">A: Technically, yes. With SEO's, web crawlers, hackers galore...
            Your information is basically stored for all to see. You might not become the next internet meme,
            but rest assured that those embarrassing photos you put at 14 years old and those cringy vids you put are
            still indexed deep inside websites and archives.</p>
